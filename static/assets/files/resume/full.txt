<rxcgames> | uk | principal devops engineer > devex (2021 - present)
- dex: built a command line tool in `go` for standardizing & orchestrating local development environments at vimeo. run and access commands for a local repository from any subdirectory on your local machine. integrates workflows and heavily used platforms via their respective APIs (github, pagerduty, jira, jenkins, slack, gcp)

<davidkohen> | uk | software engineer > core services & devops liason (2019 - 2021)
- built in-house, aggregation & billing module for the distribution of 3rd party games - increasing performance, and eliminating monthly license costs to a third-party player provider
- built a go service API for onsite retargeting of users by identifying previously visited products then returning a range of items based on criteria set in a campaign.
- migrated all client-side JS for the onsite tag from a legacy API codebase to its own codebase, significantly increasing rate and ease of deployments via CircleCI. integrated with local dev environments requiring local-specific Dockerfiles and custom configuration of the webpack-dev-server to function with our containerized services on an nginx reverse proxy
- identified & remedied expensive db queries, for ex: added caching in our php api to css properties used in onsite campaigns, cutting calls-per-minute from 60,000 to 25,0000
